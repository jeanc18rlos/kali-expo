# @kali/ui

The user interface library that powers [kali](https://kali.day) Apps.

`@kali/ui` is based on [React Native Paper](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper) but allows us to extend
components to empower our app with more features ⚡️

## Differences between React Native Paper and kali ui

- Embedded themes. @kali-ui has a very robust theming system that is directly
  integrated into our app. React Native Paper is based on Material Design
  where ours is more generalized for both iOS and Android. That doesn't make it
  any better or worse, it just means ours is directly integrated into our
  product and by controlling the library we can make changes as often as we need

- Different components & use cases. React Native Paper is really great for
  building Material-style apps where we use @kali-ui to build any type of app.
  You'll find a different series of components for different use cases.

## Installation

npm install @kali/ui
